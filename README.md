# PostmanAPITestingFramework

This framework tests open-source APIs. It includes the following features:

1. APIs are tested and the necessary validations are automated.
2. JavaScript is used for programming.
3. Newman is utilized for CLI integration.
4. Data-driven testing is implemented when needed.
5. Different environments can be integrated based on use cases (currently tested with the QA environment).
6. A pre-request script is set up for one of the API requests.
7. Tests validate the API responses received.
8. Query parameters are stored in variables.
9. Examples are provided for each API request for easier review and setup.
10. HTML reports are generated.
    
In this repository, I have included a JSON file of the collection so you can directly import it into your Postman tool for review and modification.
